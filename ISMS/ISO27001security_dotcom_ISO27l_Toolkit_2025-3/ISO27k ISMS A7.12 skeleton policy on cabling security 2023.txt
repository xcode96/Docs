Background
----------

ISO/IEC 27002:2022 clause 7.12 indicates that "Cables carrying power, data or supporting information services should be protected from interception, interference or damage [in order] to prevent loss, damage, theft or compromise of information and other associated assets and interruption to the organization’s operations related to power and communications cabling."


Policy statements
-----------------

1.	Power and telecomms lines into facilities should ideally be routed underground or protected in conduits. 

2.	Approipriate policies and procedures should protect cables against accidental damage during maintenance or building works.

3.	Data cables should be fiber-optic rather than copper where possible to reduce/detect tapping.

4.	Power cables should be physically separated from copper data cables to reduce interference.

5.	All cables should be appropriately labeled/tagged and documented for ready identification/tracing, inspection and maintenance.
